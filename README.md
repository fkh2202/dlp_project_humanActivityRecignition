**Human Activity Recognition Using LSTM-CNN**

Welcome to the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) project repository! This repository contains the code and resources for implementing a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing human activities using raw sensor data collected from mobile devices.

**Objective:**
The primary objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying human activities, such as walking, jogging, sitting, standing, and moving upstairs or downstairs, based on raw accelerometer data.

**Features:**
- Implementation of LSTM-CNN model: A deep neural network architecture combining LSTM and CNN for effective feature extraction and activity classification.
- Data Preprocessing: Includes loading the dataset, removing unnecessary characters, and converting data to the required format.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Training the model on a portion of the dataset and evaluating its performance using metrics such as F1 score on both training and test sets.
- Visualization: Visualization of accelerometer data on all three axes to provide insights into raw sensor data and model predictions.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used in this project is the WISDM (Wireless Sensor Data Mining) dataset, comprising raw accelerometer data recorded from mobile devices worn by individuals. The dataset can be downloaded from the provided link.

**Dependencies:**
The project utilizes several Python libraries and frameworks, including:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Sklearn
- Pandas
- SciPy
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Ensure that these dependencies are installed in your environment before running the code.

**Usage:**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the WISDM dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
3. Run the provided Python scripts to preprocess the data, train the LSTM-CNN model, and evaluate its performance.
4. Explore the visualization techniques to gain insights into the raw sensor data and model predictions.
