# dlp_project_humanActivityRecignition
This repository contains the code and resources for implementing a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing human activities using raw sensor data collected from mobile devices.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying human activities, such as walking, jogging, sitting, standing, and moving upstairs or downstairs, based on raw accelerometer data.
